make_frame(`<div>Setup: We've Alice and Bob at different computers, editing the same text. Something that might happen is that both Alice and Bob will simultaneously type something, like if they're both editing "cat", and Alice want's to add an apostrophy, whilst Bob wants to add an "s". What should happen if they both type their desires simultaneously? "cat's" or "cats'"? Our system will try to tackle these issues.</div>`, 'https://dglittle.github.io/cdn/images/frame1.jpg')

make_frame(`<div>Versions: This system is sort of built around some idea of versions. Broadly speaking, we mean a "version" to describe the entire state of the text at a moment in time. Both Alice and Bob above were looking at the version "cat". We identify a version with a globally unique version id. In the image, these are "A", "B", "C" and "D". Versions also have the notion of a parent, or multiple parents, or no parents -- these are the versions that a version knew about when it was created. In theory, a version's parents are ALL the versions it knew about, but in practice, it's convenient to just talk about the minimal set of parents, since some parents imply knowing about other parents. In the diagram, version "D" has parental arrows pointing to "B" and "C", but really "A" is also a parent of "D" (meaning "D" must have known about "A" when it was created, because it knew about "B", and "B" knew about "A"). I've been storing this version family-tree information in a hashmap of version ids to sets of version ids, representing the minimal parents of the given version, and then when I need the full set of parents, I calculate them on the fly using this hashmap.</div>`, 'https://dglittle.github.io/cdn/images/frame2.jpg')

make_frame(`<div>Data Structure: Here is the data structure we use to store the data about the text. It's a tree. To read its data, you start with the leftmost node, read that node, and then recursively read its children top to bottom (doing a pre-order traversal of the tree). In this case, we start with "cat", and then read its topmost child, which is "'s", and then we read that node's children top to bottom, which are "a" and "re", and then we pop back up to the next child of "cat", which is "good", giving us "cat'saregood". That is how we read the merger of all versions in the tree. If we just want to read a specific version, say version "A", then we take note of the labels on some of the nodes, e.g., "A" and "B", and here's what we do.. we do like before, but when we encounter a labeled node, we only process that node if it is our desired version, or a parent (in the theoretical sense, where we include all acenstors of our parents). We'll assume that B is not a parent or acenstor of A, and so version A must read as "cat'sregood" (missing the "a" from version B).</div>`, 'https://dglittle.github.io/cdn/images/frameSpace.jpg')

make_frame(`<div>Insertion: Say we have "GOOD" in a version called "C", and someone inserts the text "god" between the two O's in GOOD in a version called "D" (which knows about version "C", and therefor has "C" as a parent). To accomplish this, we break the node "GOOD" into two parts "GO" and "OD", and we insert "god" as the first child of "GO", and make "OD" the second child of "GO". When we read version "D" according to our rules, we'll get "GOgodOD". Note that if we read version "C", we'll still get "GOOD", because "D" is not a parent of "C".</div>`, 'https://dglittle.github.io/cdn/images/frameInsert1.jpg')

make_frame(`<div>Insertion continued: Say three people are looking at version E, which is: "Ahh!", and each person simultaneously embelishes the "Ahh!" by inserting some additional angst between the two "hh"s. Now, we've already incorporated the information from two of these people (versions F and H), and now we are receiving word of version G (which did not know about F or H, which I tried to indicate with the dotted line). In this case, we simply add G as another child of E, but we're sure to insert it such that the children are in order according to version id, with unlabeled nodes at the end. Note that the merger reads as "AhhhghgHh!", but each particular version here is only a subset of that. If someone added something to this, the parents of their new version would be F, G and H (with E implied by these).</div>`, 'https://dglittle.github.io/cdn/images/frameInsert2.jpg')


// var blah = `

// Let's create a data structure and API for syncronizing some text between two editors. Here's a first attempt.

// ---

// ## Simple Insertion Algorithm

// #### data structure:

// **data_tree**: node with these keys:
// * *text*: the raw text in this node
// * *children*: array of child nodes

// functions:

// insert_text(position, text):

//     // create a new data node
//     new_data_node = {
//         text: text from input arguments,
//         children: empty array
//     }
    
//     // insert our new data node
//     do pre-order traversal of data_tree, counting the characters in each text until we reach position:
    
//     - if we are coincidentally at the end of a node, great, just insert our new_data_node into this node's children
    
//     - if the position is somewhere in the middle of this node's text, then we'll need to split this node into two nodes. The front node will contain the text before the position, and it will have two children, one being new_data_node, and the other being the second half of this node, which will contain the rest of the text, and will inherit the children from the original node.
    
//     // return the new total text
//     do pre-order traversal of data_tree, concatenating all the texts into a giant text and returning that

// ---

// Ok, that's a good start, however, this notion of "position" is going to get messed up between editors. For example, say two people are editing "cat", and person A inserts "cute " at the beginning, and person B inserts "s are great" at the end (at position 3). Now when person A receives the insertion from person B, and they try to insert it into "cute cat" at position 3, they'll get "cuts are great cat", instead of the desired "cute cats are great".

// The idea of operational transform would be to alter the number 3 to the number 8, in this example. We'll instead go with the CRDT approach which is to handle this issue with version information in the data structure itself.

// ---

// Simple Insertion Algorithm with Versions

// data structure:

// NEW! version_to_parents = map of version ids to sets, where each set contains the parent version ids of the given version

// data_tree = pointer to a node of the form:
//     NEW! version_id -- a globally unique id, may be null
//     ..rest as before

// functions:

// insert_text(NEW! version_id, NEW! parent_ids, position, text):

//     // NEW: add this version to our versions
//     version_to_parents[version_id] = parent_ids

//     // create a new tree node
//     new_data_node = {
//         ...
//         NEW! version_id: version_id from input arguments,
//         ...
//     }
    
//     // insert our new data node
//     do pre-order traversal of data_tree, as before.. except (NEW!) we only recursively descend into children if their version_id is within parent_ids, or is transitively an ancestor of one of our parent_ids
    
//     rest as before..

// ---

// Ok, that's great, except there are some merging issues -- if two people insert text at the same time at the same location, on different machines, how do we ensure that they'll appear in the same order on both machines once they both receive each other's insertions?

// ---

// Simple Insertion Algorithm with Versions and Better Merging

// functions:

// insert_text(version_id, parent_ids, position, text):
//     ...
    
//     // insert our new data node
//     ..NEW! when we insert into children, insert such that the children are sorted by version_id, with nulls at the end (and if we need to split a node to accomodate an insertion, make the second half's version_id null, so it stays sorted after all the inserted children)
    
//     ...

// ---

// Ok, that's pretty good, though there is a subtle issue.. imagine I'm looking at the text "cat" and I insert an "s" at the end to get "cats", and then I insert an "'" to get "cat's". So we're inserting both "s" and "'" after the "t", which should be fine as long as they sort into the order "'s", but we decided to sort by version ids, so how can we be sure that the id for "'" will be before the id for "s"?

// We could just look at the existing version ids at the place of insertion and invent an id that sorts before them, however, this approach could (in principle) lead to very long version ids. Instead, we'll invent a way to insert something "after one thing, but before another thing"..

// ---

// SIA with V and BM, and Better Insertions

// functions:

// insert_text(version_id, parent_ids, position, text):
//     ...
    
//     // insert our new data node
//     ..NEW! whenever we're about to insert a node into some children, see if any of those children's version_ids are ancestors of us (i.e. are in parent_ids, or are transitively an ancestor of one of our parent_ids),
    
//     if so, pick the first such child, and insert ourselves into the beginning of it.. that is, if we're inserting into a node that contains the text "cat", we're going to split it into two nodes: "", and "cat". The first node has no text, and we'll insert ourselves as a child of it. It could be that someone before us already split "cat" into "" and "cat", in which case, we don't split "" again, we just insert ourselves into it; of course, in this case, it already has children, so we'll need to recursively apply our new technique and see if any of those children are ancestors of ours, and insert ourselves into the first such child if it exists..
    
//     ...

// ---

// I claim we're done if all we want is insertions. Let's say we also want deletions..

// ---

// SIA with V and BM and BI, and Deletes

// data structure:

// data_tree = pointer to a node of the form:
//     ...
//     NEW! deleted_by: set of version_id's that have deleted this node
    
//     NOTE: even if a node is deleted by some version, the text should still contain the text, or at least its length, so we can count it correctly for edits which did not know about the deletion when they were created.
//     ...

// functions:

// insert_text(version_id, parent_ids, position, text):
//     ...
//     NEW! when doing pre-order traversal to find position, don't count characters in node's which are deleted, i.e., node's which contain a version in deleted_by that is in parent_ids (or is transitively an ancestor of something in parent_ids)
    
//     NEW! when doing pre-order traversal to compile text to return, don't concatenate any text for node's which have anything in deleted_by

// delete_text(version_id, parent_ids, position, how_many_to_delete):
//     // add this version to our versions
//     ..just like insert_text
    
//     // delete the text
//     do pre-order traversal to find position, taking into account deleted text just like insert_text above. Now when we were inserting text, 
    
    
//     if we're in the middle of a node, split it just like
    
    
//     // return the new total text
//     ..just like insert_text

// how does it work?

// Layer 1:

// Data structures:

// time dag: map of version ids to parent-sets (each parent-set is a set of version ids)

// space tree: we have a pointer to the first node in a tree. Each node might have some verion, along with some text for that node, as well as an array of pointers to nodes which come after this one. We can read off the whole string using a "pre-order" traversal of the tree.

// we initialize the time dag to an empty map.

// we initialize the space tree to a pointer to a node which contains no text, and has no children.

// now let's insert the letter "a": first we create a unique version id, let's say "version-a". now we just make the root node in the space tree have a child -- a node with version "version-a", the text "a", and no children of it's own.





// (they are intended to be read using a "pre-order" traversal of the tree, where each node first outputs it's own text, and then it recursively processes each of it's children in order)


// sets where as hashmaps of versions to "true")



// Imagine we are syncing text between two machines, like in a google doc.
