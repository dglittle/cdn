Let's create a data structure and API for syncronizing some text between two editors. Here's a first attempt.

---

Simple Insertion Algorithm

data structure:

data_tree = pointer to a node of the form:
    text -- the raw text in this node
    children -- pointers to child nodes

functions:

insert_text(position, text):

    // create a new data node
    new_data_node = {
        text: text from input arguments,
        children: empty array
    }
    
    // insert our new data node
    do pre-order traversal of data_tree, counting the characters in each text until we reach position:
    
    - if we are coincidentally at the end of a node, great, just insert our new_data_node into this node's children
    
    - if the position is somewhere in the middle of this node's text, then we'll need to split this node into two nodes. The front node will contain the text before the position, and it will have two children, one being new_data_node, and the other being the second half of this node, which will contain the rest of the text, and will inherit the children from the original node.
    
    // return the new total text
    do pre-order traversal of data_tree, concatenating all the texts into a giant text and returning that

---

Ok, that's a good start, however, this notion of "position" is going to get messed up between editors. For example, say two people are editing "cat", and person A inserts "cute " at the beginning, and person B inserts "s are great" at the end (at position 3). Now when person A receives the insertion from person B, and they try to insert it into "cute cat" at position 3, they'll get "cuts are great cat", instead of the desired "cute cats are great".

The idea of operational transform would be to alter the number 3 to the number 8, in this example. We'll instead go with the CRDT approach which is to handle this issue with version information in the data structure itself.

Simple Insertion Algorithm with Versions

data structure:

NEW! version_to_parents = map of version ids to sets, where each set contains the parent version ids of the given version

data_tree = pointer to a node of the form:
    NEW! version_id -- a globally unique id, may be null
    ..rest as before

functions:

insert_text(NEW! version_id, NEW! parent_ids, position, text):

    // NEW: add this version to our versions
    version_to_parents[version_id] = parent_ids

    // create a new tree node
    new_data_node = {
        ...
        NEW! version_id: version_id from input arguments,
        ...
    }
    
    // insert our new data node
    do pre-order traversal of data_tree, as before.. except (NEW!) we only recursively descend into children if their version_id is within parent_ids, or is transitively an ancestor of one of our parent_ids
    
    rest as before..

---

Ok, that's great, except there are some merging issues -- if two people insert text at the same time at the same location, on different machines, how do we ensure that they'll appear in the same order on both machines once they both receive each other's insertions?

---

Simple Insertion Algorithm with Versions and Better Merging

functions:

insert_text(version_id, parent_ids, position, text):
    ...
    
    // insert our new data node
    ..NEW! when we insert into children, insert such that the children are sorted by version_id, with nulls at the end (and if we need to split a node to accomodate an insertion, make the second half's version_id null, so it stays sorted after all the inserted children)
    
    ...

---

Ok, that's pretty good, though there is a subtle issue.. imagine I'm looking at the text "cat" and I insert an "s" at the end to get "cats", and then I insert an "'" to get "cat's". So we're inserting both "s" and "'" after the "t", which should be fine as long as they sort into the order "'s", but we decided to sort by version ids, so how can we be sure that the id for "'" will be before the id for "s"?

We could just look at the existing version ids at the place of insertion and invent an id that sorts before them, however, this approach could (in principle) lead to very long version ids. Instead, we'll invent a way to insert something "after one thing, but before another thing"..

---

SIA with V and BM, and Better Insertions

functions:

insert_text(version_id, parent_ids, position, text):
    ...
    
    // insert our new data node
    ..NEW! whenever we're about to insert a node into some children, see if any of those children's version_ids are ancestors of us (i.e. are in parent_ids, or are transitively an ancestor of one of our parent_ids),
    
    if so, pick the first such child, and insert ourselves into the beginning of it.. that is, if we're inserting into a node that contains the text "cat", we're going to split it into two nodes: "", and "cat". The first node has no text, and we'll insert ourselves as a child of it. It could be that someone before us already split "cat" into "" and "cat", in which case, we don't split "" again, we just insert ourselves into it; of course, in this case, it already has children, so we'll need to recursively apply our new technique and see if any of those children are ancestors of ours, and insert ourselves into the first such child if it exists..
    
    ...

I claim we're done if all we want is insertions. Let's say we also want deletions..

---

SIA with V and BM and BI, and Deletes

data structure:

data_tree = pointer to a node of the form:
    ...
    NEW! deleted_by: set of version_id's that have deleted this node
    
    NOTE: even if a node is deleted by some version, the text should still contain the text, or at least its length, so we can count it correctly for edits which did not know about the deletion when they were created.
    ...

functions:

insert_text(version_id, parent_ids, position, text):
    ...
    NEW! when doing pre-order traversal to find position, don't count characters in node's which are deleted, i.e., node's which contain a version in deleted_by that is in parent_ids (or is transitively an ancestor of something in parent_ids)
    
    NEW! when doing pre-order traversal to compile text to return, don't concatenate any text for node's which have anything in deleted_by

delete_text(version_id, parent_ids, position, how_many_to_delete):
    // add this version to our versions
    ..just like insert_text
    
    // delete the text
    do pre-order traversal to find position, taking into account deleted text just like insert_text above. When we find the position, 
    
    
    if we're in the middle of a node, split it just like
    
    
    // return the new total text
    ..just like insert_text
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

    ...
    
    // insert our new data node
    ..NEW! whenever we're about to insert a node into some children, see if any of those children's version_ids are ancestors of us (i.e. are in parent_ids, or are transitively an ancestor of one of our parent_ids),
    
    if so, pick the first such child, and insert ourselves into the beginning of it.. that is, if we're inserting into a node that contains the text "cat", we're going to split it into two nodes: "", and "cat". The first node has no text, and we'll insert ourselves as a child of it. It could be that someone before us already split "cat" into "" and "cat", in which case, we don't split "" again, we just insert ourselves into it; of course, in this case, it already has children, so we'll need to recursively apply our new technique and see if any of those children are ancestors of ours, and insert ourselves into the first such child if it exists..
    
    ...







    
    
    
    
    do pre-order traversal of data_tree, as before.. except (NEW!) we only recursively descend into children if their version_id is within parent_ids, or is transitively an ancestor of one of our parent_ids
    
    rest as before..












version_to_parents = map of version ids to sets, where each set contains the parent version ids of the given version

data_tree = pointer to a node of the form:
    version_id -- can be null
    text -- the raw text in this node
    children -- pointers to child nodes, sorted by version_id, with null's sorted last

insert_text(version_id, parent_ids, position, text):

    // add this version to our versions
    version_to_parents[version_id] = parent_ids

    // create a new tree node
    new_data_node = {
        version_id: make up a new globally unique id,
        text: text from input,
        children: empty array
    }
    
    // insert our new tree node
    do pre-order traversal of data_tree, counting the characters in each text until we reach position:
    
    - if we are coincidentally at the end of a node, great, just insert our new_data_node into this node's children (insert it into the correct place according to the sorting rules above)
    
    - if the position is somewhere in the middle of this node's text, then we'll need to split this node into two nodes. The front node will contain the text before the position, and it will have two children, one being new_data_node, and the other being the second half of this node, which will contain the rest of the text, and will inherit the children from the original node (it will also have a version_id of null, so that it gets sorted after new_data_node).
    
    // return the new total text
    do pre-order traversal of data_tree, concatenating all the texts into a giant text and return that









    
    
    
    
    Preorder Traversal

how does it work?

Layer 1:

Data structures:

time dag: map of version ids to parent-sets (each parent-set is a set of version ids)

space tree: we have a pointer to the first node in a tree. Each node might have some verion, along with some text for that node, as well as an array of pointers to nodes which come after this one. We can read off the whole string using a "pre-order" traversal of the tree.

we initialize the time dag to an empty map.

we initialize the space tree to a pointer to a node which contains no text, and has no children.

now let's insert the letter "a": first we create a unique version id, let's say "version-a". now we just make the root node in the space tree have a child -- a node with version "version-a", the text "a", and no children of it's own.





(they are intended to be read using a "pre-order" traversal of the tree, where each node first outputs it's own text, and then it recursively processes each of it's children in order)


sets where as hashmaps of versions to "true")



Imagine we are syncing text between two machines, like in a google doc.
