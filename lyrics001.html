<b>title: forgotten me</b>

mountain crying so high
valley crying so low
I'm in the depths of a shadow, that's right
I'm in the depths of a shadow from love

and life and feeling are my only recourse
to the voyage that I'm helpless to flee
and I won't rest, till I'm sure,
that all their a's have been kicked,
and they're wishen that they hadn't crossed me

I wanna take'em one by one and shoot'em
They'd be dead, that's fine,
they're bastards why not kill them,
when I curse at them I know that it's right
when I curse at them I feel that it's right

This day I die, for all the people who die because me
This day I live, for all the people who live in spite me
This day I strive, for all the people who strive to frighten me
This day I conquer all the people who tried to conquer me
This day I forget all the people who have forgotten me
This day I hope for the day when maybe I'll be free

..

The feeling's trapped behind a gate in my mind
the key is somewhere in the land of my dreams
I fall a sleep sometimes, and wake up,
almost with the make up of a captain on an emotional sea

I wanna take'em one by one and loose'em
They'd be gone, that's fine, their worth is overstated
I want my life in the control of me
I want my life back in the control of me

This day I die, for all the times I let them get to me
This day I live, for all the times I want to live to see
This day I strive, to conquer death, outwit reality
This day I conquer what I want to, and leave the rest to be
This day I forget all the people may remember me
This day I long for the day when maybe I'll be free

This day I die, for all the times I let them get to me
This day I live, for all the times I want to live to see
This day I forget all the people who have forgotten me
This day I live for the day when maybe I'll be free

<b>title: drown me</b>

come meaning swim with me
drown me
dive with me
drown me
sink with me
give me life

go disillusionment
drown me
loosing it
drown me
stuck with it
give me life

I I wanna live but really live
I wanna love but really love
I wanna know and really know what's up
I I wanna die but really die
I wanna love but really love
I wanna cry and really cry for you
I want to know you
