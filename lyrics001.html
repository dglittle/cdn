<b>title: forgotten me</b>

mountain crying so high
valley crying so low
I'm in the depths of a shadow, that's right
I'm in the depths of a shadow from love

and life and feeling are my only recourse
to the voyage that I'm helpless to flee
and I won't rest, till I'm sure,
that all their a's have been kicked,
and they're wishen that they hadn't crossed me

I wanna take'em one by one and shoot'em
They'd be dead, that's fine,
they're bastards why not kill them,
when I curse at them I know that it's right
when I curse at them I feel that it's right

This day I die, for all the people who die because me
This day I live, for all the people who live in spite me
This day I strive, for all the people who strive to frighten me
This day I conquer all the people who tried to conquer me
This day I forget all the people who have forgotten me
This day I hope for the day when maybe I'll be free

..

The feeling's trapped behind a gate in my mind
the key is somewhere in the land of my dreams
I fall a sleep sometimes, and wake up,
almost with the make up of a captain on an emotional sea

I wanna take'em one by one and loose'em
They'd be gone, that's fine, their worth is overstated
I want my life in the control of me
I want my life back in the control of me

This day I die, for all the times I let them get to me
This day I live, for all the times I want to live to see
This day I strive, to conquer death, outwit reality
This day I conquer what I want to, and leave the rest to be
This day I forget all the people may remember me
This day I long for the day when maybe I'll be free

This day I die, for all the times I let them get to me
This day I live, for all the times I want to live to see
This day I forget all the people who have forgotten me
This day I live for the day when maybe I'll be free

<b>title: when they come for you</b>

and when they come for you, you'll go with them
and when they come for you, I'll stay
and when they come for you, you'll go with them
where will you go,
where will you go

and when they come for me, I'll go with them
and when they come for me, you'll stay
and when they come for me, I'll go with them
where will I be
where will I be

and when they come for us all, you'll go with them
and when they come for us all, I'll stay
and when they come for us all,
please stay with me,
let'em go away

we gotta find a place to hide
we gotta find a place that they don't know how to find
gotta find a place to hide
sleep
in the day, walk in the night

gotta find a place to hide
we gotta find a place that they don't know how to find
gotta find a place to hide
sleep
in the day, walk in the night

gotta find a place to hide
a place that they will never find
never see
never hear
never be

we gotta find a place to hide
we gotta find a place that they don't know how to find
gotta find a place to hide
sleep
in the day, walk in the night
walk in the night
walk under the star light
walk under the moon bright
see the mountain silhouetted against the sky
see the desert sprawled out beneath my eyes
were we ever meant to die
and were we ever meant to cry
were we ever meant to live apart

<b>title: side with the band</b>

speak softly
I'm down here in a, deep deep whole
and I can hear you just fine
really what I need is a way out
I can't climb up that, steep steep wall
if I could I don't know if I would
I kinda like it here
I see everything
I understand my life
in the deep deep whole
with the wall three feet from my face
and you wanna let me out

what do I see up there
your eyes
or the stars
fall down
fall for me
I'll catch you
fall down for me

i'm in the middle of a large lake
I've got a boat but it doesn't float that well
Fortunately I'm not thinking of floating away
bright sun over head
clouds in the way
wind against my skin
trees everywhere
the water's smooth
the water's warm
I'm sinking in
and I don't wanna go

I see you standing on the shore
you're so beautiful
I decide I want one thing more
fall in
fall for me
I'll swim with you
fall in to me

I'm in the middle of the real world
I've got real things, a washing machine
and real problems and sorrows and stress
I can't think straight all the time
the world is a problem that isn't mine
I gotta conserve what I have which isn't much
people around try to take and fill their wants
I stop drop
and feel the ground
it's real too and simple
sometimes time stops and life is simple

and you, you're one of those times
you, you're one of those times
fall down
fall for me
I'll love you
fall down for me
fall for me

<b>title: gods defeat you</b>

love is cold as the conscious weave of mind
steel is like a diamond plant
and the dream is as a silo
marching through the tempting cold
on into the mind of flat
toward the goal you can't look back
back you see the Gods defeat you
if they could they'd come and greet you

say hi and watch your back
tangled groves of thistles
fear is a pastime
passing time it whistles

..whistling..

I don't know but I could give me some time
steel is yours, if not mine
if a dream is a silo
then it must hold something I know
off into the mind and back
dragging loot across the flat
I see Gods dead around me
must have killed themselves behind me

..humming..


------------------------------------------------------------
<b>title: wave pass</b>

a shade of blue across the waist-land
flat sand
vast land
foot sand

I hear it rolling lapping folding
I hear it molding what was given
into nothing

so step aside and watch the wave pass
it's large and wide
retreat then come back
step aside and let the wave go by

so step aside and watch the wave pass
it's large and wide
retreat then come back
step aside and let the wave go by

nothing beside and nothing over
there isn't anything
to want for

swimming blue land take me over
I drank my fill
and now it's over
now it's over

so step aside and watch the wave pass
it's large and wide
retreat then come back
step aside and let the wave go by

so step aside and watch the wave pass
it's large and wide
retreat then come back
step aside and let the wave go by

the shore line
ever changing with each wave
and more time
moonshine moon pull the ocean away
my love
my dreary
sleepy sleepy place

so step aside and watch the wave pass
it's large and wide
retreat then come back
step aside and let the wave go by

so step aside and watch the wave pass
it's large and wide
retreat then come back
step aside and let the wave go by

step aside and watch the tidal wave the moon goodbye
step aside and watch the tidal wave the moon goodbye
step aside and watch the tidal wave the moon goodbye
step aside and watch the tidal wave my love goodbye

<b>title: life's pain</b>

dam in my mind
break loose I wanna cry
spill out on the pillow
and sleep
headache of mine
break down I wanna scream
scream to the mountains
and die
I don't care anymore
get away from me fiend
you're blocking the door
out
I can see feeling like this
one time toward the end
when death's at your door
but now...

life sucks
life sucks
life's bitter
life's pain
life sucks
life sucks
life's bitter
life's pain

I'll cry in my soul
if I can't on the sheets
I'll cry if I want to
and sing
headache of mine
just kill me now
you won't say where you come from

I don't care anymore

I can see feeling like this
once

life sucks
life sucks
life's bitter
life's pain
life sucks
life sucks
life's bitter
life's pain
